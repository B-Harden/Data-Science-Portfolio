# Simulations
In the following jupyter notebook I practice on how to create, run and interpret simulations using Python.

Simulation are widely used in cases where estimates are required from complex distributions of values or a hierarchy of distributions. 
To practice formulating these estimates I will attempt to estimate the range of expected profitability for a factitious lemonade stand.
The profitability of the lemonade stand depends on the number of customers arriving, the profit from the drinks they order, and the tips the customer may or may not choose to leave. The distribution of possible profits is thus, the joint distribution of customer arrivals, items ordered, and tips. In practice, such a complex distribution cannot be analyzed except using simulation.
