# Metro Nashville Police Department Incident Report via Nashville, TN Open Data Portal 
### (https://data.nashville.gov/Police/Metro-Nashville-Police-Department-Incident-Data/we5n-wkcf)

## The actual Power Bi file, with fuctional slicers and map and etc, was too large to upload to github. Therefore, I had to settle with taking a pdf view of the interactive report. However, I included an instructional on how to recreate the interactive report in Power Bi.

## Soon I will be adding a jupyter notebook Python analysis as well!
