# Microsoft Azure Web Services 
The following jupyter notebook contains code where I practice the method of Feature Selection via python and associated packages (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, etc.) using the scikit-learn provided Boston Housing Data Set. Once the features have bee selected a Linear Regression Model is fitted with our data. 
Afterwards, a Microsoft Azure Web Services is created allowing us to use our trained model to predict the medium housing value of homes based on multiple variables.
