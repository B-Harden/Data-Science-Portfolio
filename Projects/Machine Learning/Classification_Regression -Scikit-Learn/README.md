# Classification and Regression Models using Scikit-Learn

### The following jupyter notebook contains numerous Classification & Regression Models (Linear, Ridge, SVM, kNN, etc.) using Python and Scikit-Learn. 

#### The data sets used to create the models are the Pima Indians Data Set titled "pima-indians-diabetes.csv" and the Energy Output Data Set title "Folds5x2_pp.csv".

#### *Please note that this notebook is a work-in-progress and I will continue to update it with additional models, visuals, evaluations, etc.
