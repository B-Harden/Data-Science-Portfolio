# When a poultry farmer uses his regular feed, the newborn chickens have normally distributed weights with a mean of 62.2 oz. 
# In an experiment with an enriched feed mixture, nine chickens are born with the weights (in ounces) given below:

# 61.4   62.2   66.9   63.3   66.2   66.0   63.1   63.7   66.6

# Using this data, determine the probability of observing a sample mean as large or larger as you do from this sample, given the expected mean of 62.2 oz.

# Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled the blood of 52 police officers subjected to constant inhalation...
# of automobile exhaust fumes while working traffic enforcement in a primarily urban environment.
# The blood samples of these officers had an average lead concentration of 39.4 ??g/l and a SD of 11.2 ??g/l;
# a previous study of individuals from a nearby suburb, with no history of exposure, found an average blood level concentration of 35 ??g/l.
# est the hypothesis (at a 5% level of significance) that the police officers have been exposed to a higher concentration of lead. 
# Report the t statistic, the p-value, and your conclusion.
